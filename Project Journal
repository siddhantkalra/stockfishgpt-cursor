📘 Project Brief: StockfishGPT

Project Name: StockfishGPT
Maintainer: Siddhant KalraGoal: To build a web-based chess analysis platform that merges Stockfish’s real-time evaluation with GPT-style human commentary and a modern UI/UX experience.

🎯 Vision

To create an interactive and visually compelling tool that:

Analyzes chess positions live via Stockfish

Displays evaluations, best moves, and deeper insights

Offers clear, human-readable commentary (via GPT)

Supports input via FEN, PGN, and over-the-board play

Eventually becomes a lightweight alternative to Chess.com or Lichess game review features with built-in coaching

✅ Completed Milestones (as of June 8, 2025)

Phase 1: Core Evaluation Engine + UI

✅ Dark/light mode with VHS-inspired color theme

✅ Board layout with eval bar and info panels

✅ Click-to-move and drag-and-drop interaction

✅ Sound effects for move/capture/check

✅ Persistent eval panel below board (best move + eval + depth)

✅ Dynamic dropdown for engine depth selection

✅ Evaluation updates in real time as moves are made

✅ Git commits tracked at each step with automated changelog

🛠️ Current Features

Frontend:

Dynamic chessboard with notation and move history

Eval bar (currently placeholder; improvements planned)

Persistent eval panel

Dropdown to select Stockfish depth

Theme toggle (dark/light)

Sound effects for moves

Backend (Engine):

Stockfish integrated via Web Worker

Sends position fen and go depth N

Parses best move, centipawn/mate scores

Displays latest eval and move info live

🐛 Known Issues / Technical Gaps

Eval values are sometimes significantly different from Chess.com at same depth (e.g., -7.2 vs -5.3 at depth 23)

No support yet for multipv (showing more than 1 line)

No display of full engine output metadata (e.g., seldepth, nps, nodes)

Eval bar is static — does not dynamically resize

Theme selector doesn’t affect all visual components yet

📓 Log Entry: June 8, 2025

Reverted to stable Git commit (b05b479) after bloated dialog issue

Replaced temporary eval dialog with persistent UI panel

Successfully wired Stockfish best move + eval to display live

Added depth selection dropdown, wired to re-trigger analysis

Verified app behavior vs Chess.com (noted delta in eval values)

Prepared future enhancement plans for:

Multipv line support

Displaying Stockfish version in UI

Enhanced eval bar with height logic

Git changelog auto-committed after each major update

🗓️ Next Planned Tasks (June 9, 2025 and beyond)
