📘 Project Brief: StockfishGPT

Project Name: StockfishGPT
Maintainer: Siddhant KalraGoal: To build a web-based chess analysis platform that merges Stockfish’s real-time evaluation with GPT-style human commentary and a modern UI/UX experience.

🎯 Vision

To create an interactive and visually compelling tool that:

Analyzes chess positions live via Stockfish

Displays evaluations, best moves, and deeper insights

Offers clear, human-readable commentary (via GPT)

Supports input via FEN, PGN, and over-the-board play

Eventually becomes a lightweight alternative to Chess.com or Lichess game review features with built-in coaching

✅ Completed Milestones (as of June 8, 2025)

Phase 1: Core Evaluation Engine + UI

✅ Dark/light mode with VHS-inspired color theme

✅ Board layout with eval bar and info panels

✅ Click-to-move and drag-and-drop interaction

✅ Sound effects for move/capture/check

✅ Persistent eval panel below board (best move + eval + depth)

✅ Dynamic dropdown for engine depth selection

✅ Evaluation updates in real time as moves are made

✅ Git commits tracked at each step with automated changelog

🛠️ Current Features

Frontend:

Dynamic chessboard with notation and move history

Eval bar (currently placeholder; improvements planned)

Persistent eval panel

Dropdown to select Stockfish depth

Theme toggle (dark/light)

Sound effects for moves

Backend (Engine):

Stockfish integrated via Web Worker

Sends position fen and go depth N

Parses best move, centipawn/mate scores

Displays latest eval and move info live

🐛 Known Issues / Technical Gaps

Eval values are sometimes significantly different from Chess.com at same depth (e.g., -7.2 vs -5.3 at depth 23)

No support yet for multipv (showing more than 1 line)

No display of full engine output metadata (e.g., seldepth, nps, nodes)

Eval bar is static — does not dynamically resize

Theme selector doesn’t affect all visual components yet

📓 Log Entry: June 8, 2025

Reverted to stable Git commit (b05b479) after bloated dialog issue

Replaced temporary eval dialog with persistent UI panel

Successfully wired Stockfish best move + eval to display live

Added depth selection dropdown, wired to re-trigger analysis

Verified app behavior vs Chess.com (noted delta in eval values)

Prepared future enhancement plans for:

Multipv line support

Displaying Stockfish version in UI

Enhanced eval bar with height logic

Git changelog auto-committed after each major update

June 8-9, 2025

📓 Log Entry: June 9, 2025

Major progress today: converted board to full analysis mode, added navigation and board control features, and finalized cleanup from the modularization rollback. Previously integrated a full Lichess-based opening book and tested 50+ opening scenarios for robust detection.

✅ Work Completed
♟️ Analysis Mode + Interaction
Enabled full analysis mode: board now supports two-color play

Removed automatic black replies

Fixed opening detection logic during manual play and FEN/PGN input

Cleaned up game status messaging for clarity

🧭 Board Control Features
Added Clear Board button (empties board)

Added Start Position button (resets to standard starting FEN)

Added Move Navigation Arrows (|<, <, >, >|)

Created goToMove() logic to handle indexed move jumps

Known bug: re-creates Chess() instance and breaks continuity

🧰 PGN/FEN Input Panel Improvements
Made PGN and FEN panels always visible

Removed toggle logic for better UX

Unified and corrected panel header styling

📖 Opening Book Integration
Converted Lichess opening book TSV → JSON

Created openings.json with 3,500+ labeled ECO entries

Implemented FEN-based opening detection logic

Ran and passed a test suite of 50+ PGN/FEN positions

Verified matches for Ruy Lopez, Queen’s Gambit, English, Sicilian lines

Noted minor deltas in naming vs Lichess/Chess.com (due to subvariation labels)

🛠️ Codebase Reset & Stability
Reverted to monolithic index.html (commit ad05240) after failed modular split

Issues with modular version:

Broken PGN/FEN loading

Event system misfires

DOM references out of sync

Monolithic structure now considered stable for continued iteration

🐛 Known Issues
goToMove() resets Chess() context — breaks move continuity

Arrows don’t correctly update the board or highlight current move

Best move is still shown in UCI instead of SAN

Eval bar is static and does not reflect centipawn values

Engine response (Stockfish) is slower than ideal at depth 20+

No full move list interaction or clickable history yet

💡 Ideas and Future Enhancements
🔜 Short-Term Tasks
Convert UCI best move to Standard Algebraic Notation (SAN)

Fix navigation logic to retain state + history

Add live, resizable eval bar linked to cp score

Display Top 3 Stockfish lines (SAN + eval + depth)

Sync FEN import with full game history reconstruction

🚀 Long-Term Vision
PGN upload and full game review with classification

Human-style commentary via GPT (inaccuracy, blunder, strategy)

Report generator like Lichess/Chess.com post-game analysis

Smooth visual eval transitions (eval animation)

Stockfish version display, evaluation metadata (nps, depth, etc.)

Keyboard shortcuts for analysis navigation

🔢 Git Activity Summary (June 9, 2025)
